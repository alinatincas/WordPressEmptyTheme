********************** NOTE **********************
These files and folders are necessary in order for the wordpress theme to function. It is an empty theme that does not include any specific content, as this is done directly on wordpress through some plugins.

It is much easier for the client who is going to work with the website itself, instead of doing something they can hardly understand or need to learn or cannot work with.
